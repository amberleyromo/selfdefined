 a basic test to quickly evaluate whether a claim or the result of a calculation can possibly be true; when expressed literally, examines if the author of a test was sane when they wrote it; commonly used in software engineering to assess whether something is reasonable and sound.

## Issues

Connoting sanity with the thoroughness of a piece of software

## Impact

By using ableist language, we are perpetuating violence against people who experience mental or psychological disabilities. Using this language perpetuates those systems and language of harm, regardless of our intent.

## Usage Tip

Be more specific. Typically we can find an alternate definition by simply reflecting on what emotion we're really feeling.
