Previously, the r-word was used in a medical context as an umbrella term to describe people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD).

In modern use, the r-word is generally used as a denigrating term for a person with an I/DD, or to compare someone _without_ an I/DD to someone _with_ an I/DD in a derogatory sense.

## Issues

While the term was previously used in a medical context, use of the word has transitioned to having a negative connotation in modern language. Changes are being made in both the medical and legal fields to reflect that conversational shift.

[Rosa's Law was passed in 2010](https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ256/PLAW-111publ256.pdf) to eliminate all references to "mental retardation" in U.S. federal law, replacing them with "intellectual disability".

The [DSM-5 update in 2013](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Intellectual-Disability.pdf) replaced "mental retardation" with "intellectual disability".

## Impact

Regardless of whether r-word is being used to describe someone with or without an I/DD, use of the word contributes to the dehumanization, stigmatization, and negative perceptions of people with an I/DD.

## Alt Words

If you are using it to describe or refer to a person with an I/DD in a context where their I/DD is relevant, use a term that does not have a derogatory connotation ("intellectual disability", or the name of the actual disability, if applicable).

If you are using it to describe or refer to a person with an I/DD in a context where their I/DD is not relevant, don't. Describe something else about them as a person.

If you are using it to describe or refer to a person without an I/DD, don't. Use a different, more relevant, descriptive word.
